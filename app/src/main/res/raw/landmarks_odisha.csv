Out of the four such temples two are located in Odisha (one in Hirapur and the other one in Ranipur-Jharial in Bolangir Dist and the other two are in modern day Madhya Pradesh).The yogini cult practiced yoga along with tantrism. The object of worship was usually a Chakra or Wheel which had sixty four spokes, hence the name (Chausathi translates to sixty four in Odia). The presiding deity is Goddess Kali. $The yogini’s are believed to be offshoots of the Saptamatrika and are incarnations of Shakti and depicted as vivacious and seem to embrace life rather than withdraw from it. The yogini’s define and represent the ultimate feminine power.The circular open air structure is a stark departure from the tradition form of temple architecture in Odisha. This may have been necessitated by the fact that the cult worshipped the five elements – air, water, fire, earth and ether or sky. The yoginis are carved out of black slate stone and are depicted riding their vahanas (mounts) here.$One interesting aspect of the temple is that unlike other temples of that time in Odisha and Central India, one doesn’t find any erotic carvings in the yogini temples which according to historians may have been because the cult believed in celibacy as a path to salvation.","The temple was discovered in 1953 by noted historian Shri.

The temple is dedicated to Goddess Saraswati, Lord Ganesha and Lord Shiva, whose shrines have been installed here.

Most scholars believe the temple is the successor to Parashurameshvara Temple and built earlier to the Brahmeswara Temple (1060 CE).

No wonder it is hailed as a masterpiece of Odisha Temple Architecture. Historians speculate that it was called Indresvara Temple and dedicated to Lord Shiva.Today the temple today is devoid of any presiding deity, there are telltale signs in the architecture of the temple to corroborate that it was a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, the most notable one being the carving of sage Lakulisa just above the entrance door and below the navagrahas.$The temple is known as Rajarani Temple, because of the red and yellow sandstone called Rajarania that was used in its construction. With passage of time, the stone imparts an amber shade which accentuates the architectural beauty of the temple.The structural plan of the temple resembles the Kandariya Mahadev Temple of Khajuraho which can be attributed to the fact that the Somavamsi’s came to Odisha from Central India. $Unlike the sanctum sanctorum, the jagamohana (entrance hall) is devoid of any carvings (it is believed that the temple for some reasons couldn’t be completed). The stark contrast actually adds to the beauty of the temple.The temple has another interesting feature which is unique in the temple architecture of Odisha, i.e the tower over the Sanctum Sanctorum rises from the ground like a beehive with smaller miniature towers, one on top of the other merging seamlessly with it, just like a mountain range where the peak is surrounded by smaller mountains. This might well be symbolic of the yearning of the human soul trying to reach higher and higher till it merges with the eternal almighty spirit.Rajarani temple is great testament to the skillset, infinite patience and perseverance of the architects and their patrons.","Based on the sculptural architectural style, the temple is dated to the mid-11th century. Brown groups the temple along with Anant Vasudev Temple and places it around the 11th–12th centuries. Another survey of Orissa temples carried out by S. K. Saraswati in 1953 yielded a similar date. Panigrahi, who did a comprehensive analysis of Orissan temples, gives an unspecified date between Lingaraj Temple and Mukteswara Temple.[clarification needed] $Fergusson believes construction of the temple was begun by around 1105. George Michell believes the temple was built during the same time as Lingaraja Temple. Rajarani Temple roughly belongs to the same period as the Jagannath Temple at Puri. $The architecture of other temples in central India originated from this temple. The notable ones in the category are the Khajuraho temples and Totesvara Mahadeo temple in Kadawa. Scholars believe based on the style that the temple might have been built by Somavamsi kings who migrated from Central Indis to Orissa during the period.",https://i.imgur.com/XOBo4a0.jpg,https://i.imgur.com/R0ZEqs1.jpg https://i.imgur.com/9cjf7ZD.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jJIE6CU.jpg https://i.imgur.com/dXgs3ov.jpg https://i.imgur.com/NWiGVY3.jpg

Maa Hingula Pitha,OD_Angul_MaaHingulaPitha,Odisha,Angul,Talcher,20.5418,86.95,Religious Sites,NA,NA,This holy place (peetha) of the Goddess Hingula is situated on the bank of the river Simhada,"The holy place (peetha) of the Goddess Hingula is situated on the bank of the river Simhada in the West of erstwhile Talcher Estate (Now in the District of Angul). In Assam, there is a place of pilgrimage named Jwalamukhi where a similar goddess Hingula or Hingulei or Hingulaksi is being worshipped. It is for this reason that the presiding deity of Talcher in village Gopal Prasad who bears the form of fire is named Goddess Hingula. Such holy places (peethas) of Hingula are also situated even outside India in Karachi and Kabul. Both Hindus and Muslims worship at this holy place which is unique in nature.","The Hindus believe that the trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar stand for creation preservation and Destruction. This idea of trinity is quite significant and works at the root of all religious faiths. Though Brahma and Vishnu are actively involved in the worldly affairs, Maheshwar gets immersed in meditation and often forget the work allotted to him. To rouse him from his deep state of meditation, Brahma asked his faithful son Daksha to pray to the Supreme Deity for a daughter worthy of being the spouse of Maheshwar.Thus Sati was born with one condition that any slightest neglect on Dakshas part, she will immolate herself in fire. Daksha consented and Sati appeared as his daughter. Subsequently Sati got married to Maheshwar. Maheshwar was quite indifferent to the world and lived with Sati at Kailash in Tibet, now under Chinese dominion.$According to “Devi Bhagabat” years rolled on and Daksha intended to perform a Yajna, a sacrificial rite to which all the deities were invited except Shiva as he was uncanny and weird. Though Sati was not invited to the Yajna, she somehow wrested his permission to join the ceremony. The deities took up their dignified seats around the Yajna Mandap. The yajna work started smoothly. Daksha forgetful of the promise made to Sati, began speaking ill of Shiva before all the revered deities. Sati could not bear all these ill words hurled against her  husband Shiva. She immo’ated herself in the Yajna and committed suicide.Lord Shiva was omniscient so the death of his beloved wife Sati disturbed him while he was in deep meditation in Kailash. Infuriated with anger, Shiva arrived at the yajna spot. He destroyed the yajna and took up the dead body of Sati in his shoulder. Then he traveled the entire Length and breadth of India causing destruction.$Shiva’s above act concerned Lord Brahma the creator and Lord Vishnu the sustainer. In order to bring Lord Shiva to his senses Vishnu took away the dead body of Sati and ordered his wheel of death, Sudarsan Chakra to do its duty. The different parts of the body of Sati were chopped off and began to fell, wherever Shiva went. Brought to his senses after the disappearance of the dead body. Maheshwar returned to the impassable part of Himalayas to be lost in meditation.The fifty two portion of body of Sati which were chopped off by Sudarsan Chakra fell at 52 places and all became sacred sports. Out of his Satis Brahma randhra (Source of energy) fell at Hingula. It is believed that Devi Hingula was initially in Karachi which was in the undivided India before independence and now under Pakistan. She was being worshipped by king Nala from generation to generation. $In course of time King Nala ruled Vidarbha (presently Maharastra). The deity also came with him from Karachi to Vidarbha. The present peeth of Devi Hingula links to purl Jagannath temple.The king of puri went to Vidarbha and sought the help of King Nala to bring Devi Hingula to Puri. He agreed to this and the king of Puri started his journey from Vidarbha. The route from Vidarbha to Puri was probably through Raipur, Sambalpur and Talcher. These places were full of forest and were inaccessible. There was sporadic habitation. When the king reached Gopalgarh, it became evening and he took rest near Singhada River near Gopalgarh.",https://i.imgur.com/8OlFxye.jpg,https://i.imgur.com/5EynnCm.jpg https://i.imgur.com/r4jyM2N.jpg https://i.imgur.com/aUg2D17.jpg

The hot water from the spring is collected into 36 man made ponds which circumscribe the Temple.

The temperature of water in these springs varies from 40 degree Celsius to 62 degree Celsius.$The third unique thing of this hot spring is two ponds are attached with water flowing to each other, but one pond is having hot water and the other cold water.",https://i.imgur.com/eOUbyLd.jpg, NA
